I recently completed a web development project where I designed and implemented a modern and responsive login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a smooth and intuitive user experience with stylish transitions and animations.

Key Features:

ðŸ”¹User-Friendly Interface: The login page includes both sign-up and sign-in forms, allowing users to easily create an account or log in to an existing one.<br>
ðŸ”¹Social Media Integration: Users can also choose to log in or sign up using popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Google, and GitHub.<br>
ðŸ”¹Responsive Design: Ensuring optimal viewing on various devices and screen sizes.<br>
ðŸ”¹Interactive Toggle Animation: A seamless transition effect between the sign-up and sign-in forms, providing a polished and engaging user experience.<br>
ðŸ”¹Modern Aesthetics: Clean design with the use of modern fonts, icons, and color schemes to enhance visual appeal.<br>

Technologies Used:

ðŸ”§HTML5: For structuring the content.<br>
ðŸ”§CSS3: For styling and layout, including animations and transitions.<br>
ðŸ”§JavaScript: For adding interactivity and handling the form toggling logic.
